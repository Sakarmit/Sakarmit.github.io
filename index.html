            Hello! I'm Smit Sakariya, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science with a
            concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming, as well as a minor in mathematics at the University of North
            Carolina at Charlotte, which I will complete by summer 2025. I am currently also enrolled in an accelerated
            master's program, which I will complete by summer 2026. I am passionate about continuously learning and
            tackling new challenges. With a passion for backend development and debugging, I've honed my skills across
            various languages, including C#, Python, Java, and many more, with hands-on projects. Driven by the
            philosophy that giving your best effort is crucial to achieving the best results, I aspire to grow my
            knowledge and connections in the tech industry, with the ultimate goal of founding my own business. I serve
            as an instructional assistant, where I've strengthened my technical knowledge and grown personally,
            overcoming social anxiety and refining my ability to simplify complex concepts.

        <p>
            I have so far worked as an instructional assistant for Dr. A B M Mohaimenur Rahman.
            I was an IA for Web Development course during the Spring and Summer 2024 semesters.
            I am an IA for Logic and Algorithms course during the Fall 2024 semester.
            Being an IA has helped me improve my skills in communication and task management.
            I was required to communicate with students with questions they may have about assignments based in
            HTML, CSS & JS. I was also graded assignments where I ensured fairness and provided clear feedback on why
            points may have been taken off.
