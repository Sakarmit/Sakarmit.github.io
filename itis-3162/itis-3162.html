            The content on this subsite was created for the Introduction to Data Mining course taught by Professor
            Aileen Benedict, which I took in Fall 2023. The course covered a wide range of topics and approaches for
            data analysis and modeling with Python. The four projects each focused on different requirements provided by
            the professor, allowing us to locate, research, and find the datasets that we wanted to look at. The final
            project was more open-ended and allowed us to choose what we wanted to focus on. Since I wanted to learn and
            improve on the data collection and cleaning, that was the main goal of it, hence the difference from the
            other projects.
            From this course, I realized that while data analysis is not something I wish to pursue as a career, it is
            still something I am capable of learning and excelling at at an intermediate level.
