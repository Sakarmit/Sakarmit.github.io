            Course Registration the period of stress and confusion every college student faces each semester. 
            Will they get the classes they desire or most they settle for a bad class or non at all.
            During this project we will look at which factors impact the fill ratio of a class the most?
            Can we find correlation between element which can tell us which classes students should likely have backups because of them being likely to fill up the most.
